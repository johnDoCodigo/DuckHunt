Welcome to Duck Hunt, a classic shooting game brought to life!

# Description
Duck Hunt is a simple shooting game where the player tries to shoot down flying ducks as they move across the screen. The game features a score system where points are earned for hitting ducks, and points are deducted for missed shots. The player has a limited number of bullets and must reload after each shot.

# Tools used to develop this project
In order to develop this project we used: JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

HTML: used to structure the webpage and create the various elements, such as the game container and the dog and duck divs.

CSS: used to style the webpage and add visual effects to the game elements, such as the background image and the animation for the laughing dog.

JavaScript: used to create the game logic and interactivity. It was used to create the ducks and the dog, control their movement and animation, and detect user input (such as mouse clicks and key presses) to shoot the ducks.
